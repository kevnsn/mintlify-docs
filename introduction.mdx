## What is Dex?

Think of Dex as your personal relationship manager.  Use Dex to keep track of the people that matter to you:
Remember where you left off: use Dex to leave a quick note on when you last met with someone.  If you integrated with your calendar, you can see all your relationship history in one place.  
Be more thoughtful: after adding a contact, add the details that you might otherwise forget.  Do you remember the name of their children? How their last European vacation went?
Set Keep-In-Touch Reminders to reach out: when life gets busy, use Dex to remember to reach out regularly.  Keep in touch with your family, friends from college, former coworkers, and your broader professional network.
